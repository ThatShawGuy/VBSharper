VBSharper
=========

VBSharper is a set of ReSharper extensions for those of us who want/need to work in VB.Net for one reason or another.

ReSharper is an outstanding add-on for the Visual Studio IDE. The C# support in ReSharper is excellent. However, during their .Net career many developers end up working with both C# and VB.Net. VB.Net is often thought of and treated as a second-class language and inevitably this bias shows up in ReSharper (Case in point is Structural Search and Replace).

Speaking of bias, my own bias is evident here in that these extensions are written in C#. In any case, whether you enjoy working in VB.Net or not, these extensions are meant to even out the playing field and give you some much needed VB.Net code refactorings and quick fixes.

Much thanks to the ReSharper team for providing an excellent plugin framework.

Quick Fixes
-----------

Use IsNot Operator - Replace "Not x Is y" with "x IsNot y"
